                  <strong className="text-foreground">InvoFi</strong> is a decentralized platform that revolutionizes invoice financing by turning unpaid invoices into blockchain-based digital assets. These tokenized invoices can be used as collateral in a <strong className="text-foreground">peer-to-peer lending marketplace</strong>, enabling businesses to access working capital faster, more securely, and without relying on traditional banks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  InvoFi addresses a key issue many businesses face: <strong className="text-foreground">delayed cash flow</strong>. Instead of waiting weeks or months for invoice payments, companies can tokenize verified receivables and instantly receive funding from competing lenders. This creates a <strong className="text-foreground">liquid, transparent, and fair lending environment</strong>, where the best rates are determined by market demand, not centralized institutions.

                  Traditional invoice financing is slow, opaque, and centralized, often favoring large corporations and financial institutions. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are especially underserved, facing rigid requirements and high fees.
                </p>
                <p>InvoFi is built to solve these problems:</p>
