# Fixing NPM Dependency Conflicts (2025-05-05 19:39:58)

_**User**_

i am getting this error for npm install. I dont want to use the --legacy-peer-deps. Lets fix the dependencies

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. The error is occurring because there's a version conflict between React 19 (which you're using) and `react-day-picker@8.10.1` which only supports React versions 16.8.0 through 18.0.0. Let me help you fix this dependency issue.

First, let me check your package.json to see the current dependencies.


---

Read file: package.json

---

I see the issue now. You're using React 19 (`"react": "^19"`), but `react-day-picker@8.10.1` is not compatible with React 19 yet. There are a few ways we can fix this:

1. Downgrade React to version 18 (recommended for now since React 19 is still in alpha/beta)
2. Use a different date picker library that supports React 19
3. Wait for `react-day-picker` to release a version that supports React 19

I recommend option 1 since React 19 is still in early stages and many libraries haven't updated their peer dependencies yet. Let me help you update your package.json to use React 18.


---

```diff
      "next": "15.2.4",
      "next-themes": "latest",
-     "react": "^19",
+     "react": "^18.3.1",
      "react-day-picker": "8.10.1",
-     "react-dom": "^19",
+     "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
      "react-hook-form": "^7.54.1",
      "react-resizable-panels": "^2.1.7",
```

---

Now let's also update the React types to match:


---

```diff
    "devDependencies": {
      "@types/node": "^22",
-     "@types/react": "^19",
-     "@types/react-dom": "^19",
+     "@types/react": "^18.3.1",
+     "@types/react-dom": "^18.3.1",
      "postcss": "^8",
      "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",
```

---

Now you can try running `npm install` again. The dependency conflict should be resolved since we're now using React 18.3.1 which is compatible with `react-day-picker@8.10.1`.

This is a better solution than using `--legacy-peer-deps` because:
1. It ensures all dependencies are properly compatible
2. It avoids potential runtime issues that could occur with mismatched versions
3. It follows the intended peer dependency requirements of the packages

Try running `npm install` now and let me know if you encounter any other issues.

i am now not getting the previous error but a lot of wanring. Lets fix it

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. The warnings are occurring because there's a mismatch between React 19 and React 18 types, and some dependencies are trying to use React 19 while others are using React 18. Let's fix this by ensuring all React-related packages are on the same version.

Let me update your package.json to use consistent versions:


---

```diff
      "next": "15.2.4",
      "next-themes": "latest",
-     "react": "^18.3.1",
+     "react": "18.3.1",
      "react-day-picker": "8.10.1",
-     "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
+     "react-dom": "18.3.1",
      "react-hook-form": "^7.54.1",
      "react-resizable-panels": "^2.1.7",
```

```diff
    "devDependencies": {
      "@types/node": "^22",
-     "@types/react": "^18.3.1",
-     "@types/react-dom": "^18.3.1",
+     "@types/react": "18.3.1",
+     "@types/react-dom": "18.3.1",
      "postcss": "^8",
      "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",
```

---

Now let's clean up the node_modules and package-lock.json to ensure a fresh install:


---

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

```
(base) ?➜  invofi git:(develop/frontend) ?✗ 

```

---

Now let's install the dependencies again:


---

```bash
npm install
```

```
(base) ?➜  invofi git:(develop/frontend) ?✗ npm install
⠏
```
