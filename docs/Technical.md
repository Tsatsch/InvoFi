# InvoFi: Revolutionizing Invoice Financing with Solana

## 1. Introduction: The Problem & Our Vision

Traditional invoice financing is often slow, expensive, and inaccessible, particularly for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). Businesses face cash flow challenges waiting for invoices to be paid, hindering growth and operational efficiency.

**InvoFi's vision is to democratize access to liquidity by transforming invoices into tradable digital assets on the Solana blockchain.** We aim to provide businesses with instant access to working capital, while offering a new, transparent, and potentially high-yield asset class for liquidity providers and investors.

## 2. Core Technology Stack

*   **Blockchain:** Solana (for speed, low transaction costs, and scalability).
*   **Smart Contracts:** Anchor Framework (for rapid and secure Solana program development).
*   **NFT Standard:** MPL Core (Metaplex Digital Asset Standard) for flexible and extensible on-chain representation of invoices.
*   **Off-Chain Data Storage:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) for managing mutable invoice data, user details, and application state.
*   **Decentralized File Storage:** Arweave (via Irys) for immutable storage of invoice PDFs and NFT JSON metadata.
*   **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS.
*   **Wallet Integration:** `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` for seamless wallet connections (Phantom, Solflare, etc.).
*   **JS/TS Tooling:** UMI (Unified Metaplex Interface) for client-side interaction with Metaplex programs and Arweave.

## 3. Project Implementation: Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Invoice Origination, Verification, and NFT Tokenization

**Objective:** To establish a secure and transparent pipeline for users to create invoices, have them verified, and tokenize them as unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on Solana. The NFT will represent the invoice, with key metadata on-chain and detailed information stored immutably off-chin.

**Workflow & Technology Application:**

1.  **Invoice Generation (Frontend & Supabase):**
    *   **User Action:** A business (invoice issuer) uses the InvoFi frontend to create an invoice by filling out a form with details (issuer, recipient/debtor, items, amounts, due date, etc.).
    *   **Technology:** Invoice data is initially saved to a **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** database with a status like `DRAFT`. Supabase serves as the primary off-chain datastore for invoice lifecycle management. The user's connected Solana wallet address is associated with this invoice.
    *   The user can download a system-generated **PDF** of this invoice.

2.  **Counterparty Acknowledgment & Initial Risk Assessment (Off-Chain & Automated Logic):**
    *   **User Action:** The issuer sends the invoice (e.g., via a secure link or notification from InvoFi) to the counterparty (debtor) for acknowledgment/signature.
    *   **Technology:** This step might involve a simple off-chain mechanism (e.g., email-based link verification or a dedicated portal for counterparties if they are also users). Upon acknowledgment, the invoice status in Supabase changes to `PENDING_ADMIN_APPROVAL`.
    *   Automated checks (e.g., based on invoice amount, debtor reputation if available) can assign an **initial risk score**, stored in Supabase.

3.  **Admin Verification & Approval (Admin Panel & Supabase):**
    *   **Admin Action:** Whitelisted InvoFi administrators review pending invoices via an admin dashboard. They can download the PDF for review.
    *   **Technology:** The admin panel interacts with Supabase. Admins set a **final risk score** and approve or reject the invoice.
    *   Upon approval, the invoice status in Supabase is updated to `APPROVED_FOR_TOKENIZATION`, enabling the "Tokenize" button for the user on their dashboard.

4.  **Tokenization Process (User-Initiated via Frontend, Orchestrated by JS/TS services):**
    *   **User Action:** The user clicks the "Tokenize" button for an approved invoice.
    *   **Technology - PDF & Metadata Storage (Arweave/Irys):**
        *   A JS/TS service (Next.js API route or client-side UMI script) takes the final invoice data from Supabase.
        *   The official invoice PDF is generated (if not already finalized) and uploaded to **Arweave via Irys**. The Arweave URI is stored in Supabase (`pdf_uri`).
        *   A **Metaplex-compliant JSON metadata file** is constructed. This JSON includes:
            *   Standard NFT fields (`name`, `symbol`, `description`).
            *   A link (`image` or `animation_url`) to the Arweave-hosted PDF or a preview image.
            *   `external_url` pointing to the invoice's detail page on InvoFi.
            *   Crucial `attributes` like `SupabaseInvoiceID`, `InvoiceNumber`, `TotalAmount`, `Currency`, `DueDate`, and the `FinalRiskScore`.
            *   `properties.files` array linking to the Arweave URI of the PDF.
        *   This JSON metadata is uploaded to **Arweave via Irys**. The Arweave URI is stored in Supabase (`nft_metadata_uri`).
    *   **Technology - NFT Minting (Anchor & MPL Core):**
        *   The JS/TS service then calls the `mint_invoice_nft` instruction of InvoFi's **Anchor smart contract**.
        *   The Anchor program uses a Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) to the **MPL Core program** to mint a new digital asset.
        *   **On-chain Data:**
            *   The `uri` field of the MPL Core asset points to the Arweave URI of the JSON metadata.
            *   Key invoice details (Invoice Number, Amount, Currency, Due Date, SupabaseInvoiceID, FinalRiskScore) are stored directly on-chain as `Attributes` using the MPL Core Attributes Plugin.
        *   The newly minted NFT is owned by the user who initiated the tokenization.
    *   **Technology - Finalization:**
        *   The `nft_mint_address` is saved to Supabase, and the invoice status is updated to `TOKENIZED`.
        *   The user can now see their tokenized invoice on their dashboard, with links to Solscan (to verify on-chain data) and the Arweave-hosted PDF.

**Outcome of Phase 1:** Businesses can convert their verified invoices into unique, self-owned Solana NFTs. These NFTs carry essential data on-chain and link to comprehensive details and the official document on decentralized storage.

### Phase 2: Financialization - Liquidity Pools, AMM, and Advanced Features

**Objective:** To enable financial operations on the tokenized invoices, allowing businesses to access liquidity and investors to participate in this new asset class. This phase will introduce a **secure Vault program** and integrate with an **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**.

**Workflow & Technology Application:**

1.  **NFT Vault Program (Anchor):**
    *   **Purpose:** A dedicated smart contract to securely hold invoice NFTs when they are used in financial operations.
    *   **Technology:** An Anchor program with instructions like `deposit_invoice_nft` and `withdraw_invoice_nft`.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Users will deposit their InvoFi NFTs into the vault to participate in AMM pools or use them as collateral.
        *   The vault will be controlled by program logic, ensuring NFTs are handled according to predefined rules.

2.  **Automated Market Maker (AMM) Integration (e.g., probably integration with Meteora or own Custom solution):**
    *   **Purpose:** To create a marketplace for buying and selling tokenized invoices (or fractions thereof) and for businesses to get instant financing.
    *   **Technology:**
        *   **Liquidity Pools:** LPs (Liquidity Providers, potentially including banks as outlined in InvoFi docs) will deposit stablecoins (e.g., USDC) into pools.
        *   **Invoice NFT Pricing:** The AMM will price invoice NFTs based on factors like their on-chain risk score, due date (time decay), and market demand.
        *   **Process:**
            1.  A business deposits their InvoFi NFT into the InvoFi Vault, which is linked to an AMM pool.
            2.  The AMM prices the NFT, and the business receives immediate funding (e.g., 80-90% of the invoice value in stablecoins) from the liquidity pool. The NFT is now effectively owned or collateralized by the pool (via the Vault).
            3.  LPs earn yield from the discounts/fees applied to these financing operations.
            4.  When the original invoice is paid by the debtor (off-chain payment reconciled via InvoFi), the funds are routed to the AMM pool to repay LPs and potentially release/settle the NFT.

3.  **Fractionalization (Future Enhancement within Phase 2):**
    *   **Purpose:** For very large invoices, or to allow broader participation, an InvoFi NFT held in the Vault could be fractionalized into many smaller SPL tokens.
    *   **Technology:** The Vault program could manage the locked master NFT, while another program (or an extension of the vault) handles the minting and distribution of fractional SPL tokens representing claims on the underlying invoice.

4.  **Collateralized Lending (Future Enhancement within Phase 2):**
    *   **Purpose:** Businesses can use their InvoFi NFTs as collateral to borrow stablecoins.
    *   **Technology:** NFTs would be deposited into the InvoFi Vault. A lending protocol (either custom or integrated) would assess the collateral value (based on risk score, amount, etc.) and allow borrowing against it.

**Outcome of Phase 2:** InvoFi evolves into a true DeFi protocol where tokenized invoices are not just representations but active financial instruments, unlocking liquidity and creating new investment opportunities.

## 4. Conclusion

InvoFi, by leveraging Solana's performance, the flexibility of MPL Core NFTs, the immutability of Arweave, and the robust data management of Supabase, is poised to significantly improve the invoice financing landscape. The phased approach ensures a solid foundation before introducing more complex DeFi mechanics, ultimately creating a transparent, efficient, and accessible platform for businesses and investors alike.
