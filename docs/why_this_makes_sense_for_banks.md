## Why This Makes Sense for Banks

InvoFi opens a new, **DeFi-native channel** for financing real-world receivables and creates multiple roles where financial institutions can participate and profit.

Here’s how:

💼 **1. As a Liquidity Provider**  
Banks can deposit capital into invoice pools to earn **real-world yield**, accessing a new asset class of short-term, real-economy lending with **on-chain transparency** and risk-adjusted returns.

🛡️ **2. As a Verification Oracle**  
Banks already have the infrastructure to validate invoice authenticity and debtor credibility. By acting as a **trusted oracle**, banks can earn fees per verified invoice while maintaining high-quality standards in the protocol.

🧠 **3. As a Protocol Operator or Pool Manager**  
Banks can **run and manage permissioned pools** (e.g., for corporate clients), earning **management or performance fees** while ensuring **regulatory compliance** and **risk controls**.

💰 **4. As a Risk Underwriter**  
Banks can offer **insurance on invoice repayment** or **default guarantees**, creating a new premium-based business model built on top of the protocol.

**InvoFi** offers banks a compliant, revenue-generating entry point into tokenized real-world assets — turning receivables into **yield-generating instruments** for the next era of finance.
