# Next.js Project Creation Error Troubleshooting (2025-05-03 18:56:13)

_**User**_

what is this issue i am getting when creating a new nextjs project in the very end. I am getting this error when writing component.json

fix it



---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you investigate and fix this issue. The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'resolvedPaths')" typically occurs in Next.js projects when there's a configuration issue. Let me check your project structure and configuration files.

First, I'll look at your project structure:


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **6** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `invofi` |
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📄 `.cursorindexingignore` |
| 📁 `.specstory` |
| 📄 `README.md` |

</details>

---

Let me check the contents of your Next.js configuration file:


---

Read file: invofi/next.config.ts

---

I see the issue. The error you're getting is related to the Next.js configuration. The problem is that you're using a `.ts` extension for your Next.js config file, but Next.js expects it to be either `next.config.js` or `next.config.mjs`. Let me fix this by renaming and updating the configuration file:


---

undefined

---

Now, I'll create the correct configuration file:


---

```diff
- 
+ /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
+ const nextConfig = {
+   reactStrictMode: true,
+   swcMinify: true,
+ };
+ 
+ module.exports = nextConfig; 
```

---

I've made the following changes to fix your issue:

1. Removed the `next.config.ts` file which was causing the problem
2. Created a new `next.config.js` file with the correct extension and configuration

The error you were seeing was because Next.js doesn't support TypeScript configuration files by default. The configuration file should be either:
- `next.config.js` (CommonJS)
- `next.config.mjs` (ES Modules)

The new configuration I've added includes:
- `reactStrictMode: true` for better development experience
- `swcMinify: true` for faster builds

Try running your Next.js project again. The error should be resolved now. If you need to add any specific configuration options, you can add them to the `nextConfig` object in the new `next.config.js` file.

Let me know if you need any additional help or if you'd like to add any specific configuration options to your Next.js project!

what do i need to do now to resolve the issue and from which directory

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you with the next steps. First, let's check if we're in the correct directory and what files we have:


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory invofi • **13** results</summary>
        
| Name |

| 📄 `postcss.config.mjs` |
| 📁 `public` |
| 📄 `README.md` |
| 📄 `eslint.config.mjs` |

</details>

---

You need to be in the `invofi` directory to run the Next.js project. Let me help you with the commands to resolve the issue:


---

```bash
cd invofi && npm install && npm run dev
```

```
un dev                                         cd invofi && npm install && npm run dev                     c
d invofi && npm install && npm run dev                                         cd invofi    npm            n

we need to fix this error

when i am doing npm run dev

_**Assistant**_

The warning you are seeing:

```
Invalid next.config.js options detected: 
 ⚠     Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'swcMinify'
```

means that the `swcMinify` option is no longer valid in your version of Next.js (15.2.4). This option was used in older versions, but has since been removed or replaced.

## How to fix

**Remove the `swcMinify` line from your `next.config.js` file.**  
Your config should look like this:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

Would you like me to make this change for you?

_**User**_

with what do we replace it?

---

_**Assistant**_

In Next.js 13 and later (including 15.x), the `swcMinify` option is no longer needed or supported. SWC is now the default minifier, and there is no replacement config option required for minification.

**You do not need to replace it with anything.**  
Just remove the `swcMinify` line. Minification will still happen automatically in production builds.

If you want to customize minification or use a different minifier, you would need to use custom plugins or advanced configuration, but for almost all projects, the default is sufficient and recommended.

**Summary:**  
- Remove `swcMinify` from your config.
- No replacement is needed.
- Your config should look like this:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

i have the vercel integration now, but i am getting not found, what hte issue and where to conifgure, now the frontend-base branch is relevant

Read file: invofi/app/page.tsx

---

Your `app/page.tsx` is correctly set up and should render the root route (`/`). If you are getting a "Not Found" error on Vercel, here are the most common causes and what to check:

---

## 1. **Vercel Project Settings**
- Make sure your Vercel project is connected to the correct repository and branch (`frontend-base`).
- In Vercel dashboard, check that the "Production Branch" is set to `frontend-base`.

## 2. **Build Output Directory**
- Next.js (with the `/app` directory) should not need any custom output directory. Vercel will automatically detect and use `.next`.

## 3. **Root Route Exists**
- You have `app/page.tsx`, which is correct for the root route (`/`).

## 4. **Deployment Logs**
- In the Vercel dashboard, check the deployment logs for any build or runtime errors.

## 5. **Base Path or Custom Routing**
- If you have set a `basePath` in `next.config.js`, your site would be served from `/basePath` instead of `/`.
- Your current `next.config.js` does not set a `basePath`, so this should not be an issue.

## 6. **404 on Static Assets**
- If you see 404s for images like `/next.svg`, make sure those files exist in the `public/` directory.

---

### What to do next

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to your project in Vercel.
   - Make sure the "Production Branch" is set to `frontend-base`.
   - Redeploy if needed.

2. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Look for any errors or warnings during build or deployment.

3. **Check Routing:**
   - Visit the root URL of your deployed site (e.g., `https://your-vercel-project.vercel.app/`).
   - If you see "Not Found", try accessing `/page` or `/app/page` to see if routing is misconfigured.

4. **Check for `public/` Assets:**
   - Make sure all images referenced in your code (like `/next.svg`, `/vercel.svg`, etc.) exist in the `public/` directory.

---

**If you want, you can share the Vercel deployment logs or the URL, and I can help you debug further.**

Would you like to check any of these steps together, or do you want to share your Vercel logs for more targeted help?
