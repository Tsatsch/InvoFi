# Integrating Logo into README (2025-05-13 17:06:24)

_**User**_

lets integrate the logo into the readme

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you integrate the InvoFi logo into the README.md file. I notice you have `invofi.svg` in your public directory which would be perfect for this purpose. I'll add it near the top of the README, right after the title.

Let me edit the README file to include the logo:

  ## üåê What is InvoFi?
  InvoFi is a decentralized platform that transforms unpaid invoices into blockchain-based digital assets. Verified invoices are tokenized as NFTs and instantly financed through a decentralized liquidity pool powered by an Automated Market Maker (AMM) ‚Äî enabling businesses to unlock working capital in minutes, not months.

I've added the InvoFi logo to your README.md file. The logo is now displayed right after the title and before the "What is InvoFi?" section. I used the SVG version of the logo since it will look crisp at any size and loads quickly.

The logo is referenced using a relative path to the public directory where your assets are stored. This should work well when viewing the README both on GitHub and locally.

Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust about the logo placement or the README in general?

_**User**_

now the logo is too bug, i want it to be aligned with text

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the README to make the logo smaller and better aligned with the text. In Markdown, we can control the image size using HTML attributes.


---

```diff
  # InvoFi
  
- ![InvoFi Logo](invofi/public/invofi.svg)
+ <img src="invofi/public/invofi.svg" alt="InvoFi Logo" width="200" align="left" style="margin-right: 20px;">
  
  ## üåê What is InvoFi?
```

---

I've made the following changes to improve the logo presentation:
1. Changed the image to use HTML `<img>` tag for better control
2. Set the width to 200 pixels to make it smaller
3. Added `align="left"` to align it with the text
4. Added a right margin of 20px to create some space between the logo and the text

The logo should now be more proportional and better integrated with the text content. Let me know if you'd like me to adjust the size or alignment further!
