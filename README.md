## What is InvoFi?
InvoFi is a decentralized platform that transforms unpaid invoices into blockchain-based digital assets. Verified invoices are tokenized as NFTs and instantly financed through a decentralized liquidity pool powered by an Automated Market Maker (AMM) â€” enabling businesses to unlock working capital in minutes, not months.

For more details on how the AMM works, see [How the AMM Works](docs/how_the_amm_works.md).

Instead of relying on banks or waiting for slow invoice payments, businesses upload verified receivables and receive immediate funding at transparent, market-driven rates. InvoFi reimagines invoice factoring through a **DeFi-native, programmable**, and **fraud-resistant** protocol.

InvoFi opens a new, DeFi-native channel for financing real-world receivables and creates multiple roles where financial institutions can participate and profit.

## ðŸ’¡The Vision

InvoFi's mission is to democratize invoice financing by building a protocol that is:

- Transparent and programmable
